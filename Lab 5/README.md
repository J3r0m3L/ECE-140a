## Tutorials
### Tutorial 1:
In this lab I learned about env files, and how they can be used in Python. I also learned how python can be used to access Mysql, and the mysql.connector and dotenv libraries. Lastly I learned that after any change to a table I have use db.commit() command.

### Tutorial 2:
In this tutorial, I learned about Jinja2 Templating, and essentially how to get data from a database and display in an HTML file. I also had more practice with ENV files, and loading them into python.

### Tutorial 3:
In this tutorial, I was able to put together everything learned in the previous tutorials to have the frontend html make a call to javascript which makes a call to the python script, which grabs the data from our database and renders in the html file. 

## Challenges
### Challenge 1:
For this challenge I created the select elements which served as inputs for the two javascript functions. When a user selects a option and presses the submit button they trigger an onclick event which calls a single function which then calls one of the two required functions. Then they send information to our pyramid server which retrieves the image JSON from our MYSQL database.
