## Challenges 
### Challenges 1
#### ANS1: 
<!DOCTYPE html> is a declaration required at the beginning of every HTML document. It tells the web browser that HTML is in the file and ensures that the page is parsed in the same way. 

#### ANS2:
Nothing changed in the webpage display after I changed the text within the Title Tags.

#### ANS3:
In HTML, the browser formats the text based off of the first tag. So in this case since there is an h5 opening tag and an h6 closing tag, the text is formatted to h5 specifications.

#### ANS4.1:
After italicising and changing the font to Times New Roman in the browser, I refreshed the page and found that it defaulted back to the orignal styling. This is because it refers to the html file upon refresh and disregards our changes. Editing the file doesn't change the actual file.

#### ANS4.2
Now because we edited the css file associated with the html the changes are implemented and are displayed upon refresh. Yes I see the changes upon refreshing.

## Tutorials
### Tutorial 1: Setting up Git and Github account
Before this tutorial I mainly used github desktop, and was not too familiar with Gitbash. However, I learned 
several git commands including ones that enables the user to initialize new repositories. I also gained a deeper 
understanding of merge conflicts.

### Tutorial 2: Setting up Python and Jupyter
In this tutorial I learned about the more about Anaconda, and more about the IDE Spyder, which I hadn't really heard of until this Tutorial. 

### Tutorial 3: Learning the basics of Python
In this tutorial I learned about enumeration over an array, as well as the del() and append() methods. 

### Tutorial 4: Learning the basics of Web Scraping
In this tutorial I learned about scraping in general with the Bs4, along with more about using Jupyter Notebook. To answer the question in the tutorial, I didn't notice too large a difference in this case, but I think prettify is supposed to add indents to the html and breaks to make it more readable.
