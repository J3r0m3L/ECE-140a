## Tutorials
### Tutorial 1: 
In this tutorial, I learned about Numpy restructuring, resizing, vertical and horizontal stacking, and linspace and arange functions. I also got some experience working with each and am familiar with the syntax now.

### Tutorial 2:
In this tutorial, I learned that OpenCV is called through "cv2" instead of just "cv", and I learned that the main purpose of OpenCV is an image processing library. Also, I learned that there is a ton of ways to modify images through OpenCV and gather information on an image.

### Tutorial 3:
I learned how to host static HTML pages on a server with pyramid, and I learned the Pyramid syntax.

### Tutorial 4:
I learned the basics of getting images from the public folder, using pyramid python, javascript, and html. I also, learned the pyramid boiler plate code as well how to import images into a python file.

## Challenges:
### Challenge 1:
The objective of this challenge was to take the Music.html and Index.html from the portfolio challenge in Lab 1 and serve it with the Pyramid framework. To do this I copied over the resume, my picture, and the content with both html files. Then I modified the href tags to work with my app.py which holds two routes: ./ and ./music.

### Challenge 2:
The objective of this challenge was to recreate the webpage in tutorial_opencv but add a price function that takes data gathered from the image and uses that to calculate the appropriate price. To do this I created a new "get_price()" function with new routes that first calculated the appropriate price and then displayed the information to the html page. Also, when the price button is clicked it removes the img so only the price is displayed and in vice versa for when the display button is clicked.
