## Tutorials
### Tutorial 1: 
In this tutorial, I learned that the today.getTime() returns a number representing the time difference between January 1 1970 UTC and the current date/time, and we can use any timezone as long as we give the proper offset. I also, learned about addEventListeners and how they take in user input. 

### Tutorial 2:
In this tutorial, I learned that the Web API, Finance Modeling Prep returns a JSON object, and that Apple is professor Ramsin's favorite stock. I also learned the general definition of Web API. 

## Challenges
### Challenge 1:
Submission Link: https://codepen.io/Faradays-Dynamite4/pen/WNZWmNy
For this challenge I added the AM/PM functionality to my clock. I did this by checking in the function that sets the time, if the .getHour is greater than 12. If so, I subtract 12 from the .getHour and set AM to PM.

### Challenge 2:
Submission Link: https://codepen.io/Faradays-Dynamite4/pen/MWEMmGO
For this challenge I reviewed the API documentation and used fetch method to grab the data since the getRequest "wasn't defined". I added the Company Name, Price, Industry, and Website, with a link to the actual website.
